#About
iTrafficIndicator shows a spinning wheel in the menu bar to indicate network activy. When there is no activity the indicator is stopped.
#The indicator behaves like the one on iOS.

The spinning wheel in the menu bar only reports network activy, when traffic crosses a certain threshold - by default more than 1000 bytes/second (configurable).

This behaviour tries to roughly emulate the way the spinning wheel on the iphone works which also doesnt spin for 'background noise'.


A click on the icon reveals lots of additional info. It gives you detailed info for any bytes transmitted or received.
